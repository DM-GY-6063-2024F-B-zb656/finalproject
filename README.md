## Idea 1

Something with buttons and sound - maybe a memory game type thing where the computer will play certain sounds, and buttons on the Arduino are also linked to sounds in p5.js and you have to recreate the sound patterns. Like the computer will generate random sound patterns that grow by 1 every time, and if the sound input returned by the Arduino matches what the computer did you get a point. Game just goes on forever until you fail, but keeps track of highest score.
